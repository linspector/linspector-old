This is the manual page for Lish - The Linspector interactive Shell
===================================================================

Introduction
------------

Lish ist the Linspecor interactive Shell. It is the primary interface for
managing a Linspector instance. It is a command prompt like a normal
system shell for accessing all kind of objects.

In Lish you can enable or disable services when a service fails to stop
alerting. You can list current running jobs ang get detailed information
about single jobs.

Since Lish is under heavy development and we have not defined the syntax
most features are not implemented but will be when we are releasing the
first production release of Linspector.

`jobs @all list` lists all jobs and `jobs %foobar list` lists all jobs for
Host "foobar".
