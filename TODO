 - Parent alerting (escalation)
 - Core Error alerting to core["members"] on internal errors
 - Hostgroup Parents (if the Hostgroup "network" is down, don't alert for the server hosts)
 - Add more services
 - Add more tasks e.g. storage in mongodb or mariadb and some more alerts like jabber and SMS
